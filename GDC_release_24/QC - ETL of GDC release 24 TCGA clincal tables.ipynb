Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer has spread from the original site to other parts of the body. The accepted values for tumor_stage depend on the tumor site, type, and accepted staging system. These items should accompany the tumor_stage value as associated metadata.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tdiag__tissue_or_organ_of_origin\n","\n","\tThe text term used to describe the anatomic site of origin, of the patient's malignant disease, as described by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O).\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tdiag__prior_malignancy\n","\n","\tThe yes/no/unknown indicator used to describe the patient's history of prior cancer diagnosis.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tdiag__state\n","\n","\tThe current state of the object.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tdiag__created_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tdiag__updated_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__exposure_id\n","\n","\t\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__height\n","\n","\tThe height of the patient in centimeters.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__weight\n","\n","\tThe weight of the patient measured in kilograms.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__bmi\n","\n","\tA calculated numerical quantity that represents an individual's weight to height ratio.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__years_smoked\n","\n","\tNumeric value (or unknown) to represent the number of years a person has been smoking.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__cigarettes_per_day\n","\n","\tThe average number of cigarettes smoked per day.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__alcohol_history\n","\n","\tA response to a question that asks whether the participant has consumed at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage in their lifetime.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__alcohol_intensity\n","\n","\tCategory to describe the patient's current level of alcohol use as self-reported by the patient.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__state\n","\n","\tThe current state of the object.\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__created_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\texpose__updated_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tstate\n","\n","\t\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tcreated_datetime\n","\n","\t\n","\n","rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","\tupdated_datetime\n","\n","\t\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NFhE0fOgba4c","colab_type":"code","outputId":"5bcc1ac0-3e94-4274-ce3d-7b30377a4172","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591656950162,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":2147,"user":{"displayName":"Madelyn Reyes","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgDt21l4jQzX7DE0-eIgxJOD8CGKDsWJk_AdbLRnA=s64","userId":"07695745626185750440"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000}},"source":["# check for empty schemas in dataset rel24_clin_VAREPOP\n","\n","clin_table = Table('`isb-project-zero`.GDC_Clinical_Data.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS')\n","clin_query = Query.from_(clin_table) \\\n","                  .select('table_name, column_name, description') \\\n","                  .where(clin_table.table_name=='rel24_clin_VAREPOP') \\\n","\n","clin_query_clean = str(clin_query).replace('\"', \"\")\n","clin = client.query(clin_query_clean).to_dataframe()\n","pandas.options.display.max_rows\n","print(\"Are there any empty cells in the table schema?\")\n","print(clin)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Are there any empty cells in the table schema?\n","            table_name  ...                                        description\n","0   rel24_clin_VAREPOP  ...                                                   \n","1   rel24_clin_VAREPOP  ...                                                   \n","2   rel24_clin_VAREPOP  ...
