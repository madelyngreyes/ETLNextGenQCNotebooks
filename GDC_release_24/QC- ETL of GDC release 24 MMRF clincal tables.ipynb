Staging is usually based on the size of the tumor, whether lymph nodes contain cancer, and whether the cancer has spread from the original site to other parts of the body. The accepted values for tumor_stage depend on the tumor site, type, and accepted staging system. These items should accompany the tumor_stage value as associated metadata.\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tdiag__iss_stage\n","\n","\tThe multiple myeloma disease stage at diagnosis.\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tdiag__tissue_or_organ_of_origin\n","\n","\tThe text term used to describe the anatomic site of origin, of the patient's malignant disease, as described by the World Health Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O).\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tdiag__state\n","\n","\tThe current state of the object.\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tdiag__created_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tdiag__updated_datetime\n","\n","\tA combination of date and time of day in the form [-]CCYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss[Z|(+|-)hh:mm]\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tstate\n","\n","\t\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tcreated_datetime\n","\n","\t\n","\n","rel24_clin_MMRF\n","\n","\tupdated_datetime\n","\n","\t\n","\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"NFhE0fOgba4c","colab_type":"code","outputId":"d460e2dd-fa85-4e2b-9032-1dfdf0625b34","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1591388285663,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1480,"user":{"displayName":"Madelyn Reyes","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgDt21l4jQzX7DE0-eIgxJOD8CGKDsWJk_AdbLRnA=s64","userId":"07695745626185750440"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":782}},"source":["# check for empty schemas in dataset rel24_clin_MMRF \n","\n","clin_table = Table('`isb-project-zero`.GDC_Clinical_Data.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMN_FIELD_PATHS')\n","clin_query = Query.from_(clin_table) \\\n","                  .select('table_name, column_name, description') \\\n","                  .where(clin_table.table_name=='rel24_clin_MMRF') \\\n","\n","clin_query_clean = str(clin_query).replace('\"', \"\")\n","clin = client.query(clin_query_clean).to_dataframe()\n","pandas.options.display.max_rows\n","print(\"Are there any empty cells in the table schema?\")\n","print(clin)"],"execution_count":36,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Are there any empty cells in the table schema?\n","         table_name  ...                                        description\n","0   rel24_clin_MMRF  ...                                                   \n","1   rel24_clin_MMRF  ...                                                   \n","2   rel24_clin_MMRF  ...
